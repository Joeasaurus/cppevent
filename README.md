# cppevent

Basic on/emit event pattern for C++11. Includes rudimentary timed events.

## Wha?
This is a small library using lambdas and threads for easy callback events. Please see src/example.cpp.

The CMakeLists here will allow you to build a shared lib from the code, but I find it easier to just include the source via git submodule.
